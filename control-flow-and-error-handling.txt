JavaScript supports a compact set of statements, specifically control flow statements, 
that you can use to incorporate a great deal of interactivity in your application. 
This chapter provides an overview of these statements.

The JavaScript reference contains exhaustive details about the statements in this chapter. 
The semicolon (;) character is used to separate statements in JavaScript code.

Any JavaScript expression is also a statement. See Expressions and operators for complete 
information about expressions.

Block statement
The most basic statement is a block statement, which is used to group statements. 
The block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets:

{
  statement_1;
  statement_2;
  â‹®
  statement_n;
}
Example
Block statements are commonly used with control flow statements (if, for, while).

while (x < 10) {
  x++;
}
Here, { x++; } is the block statement.
